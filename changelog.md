# The changes I made to my portfolio website were adding a confirm button for when a user wants to message me on my "contact me" page and is submitting a form, and it will confirm
# with the user if they are sure they want to submit the form.

# Another change I implemented was when the user clicks on my photo, it will sent out an alert that sends out a little message describing who I am.
